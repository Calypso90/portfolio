            I'm a Software Developer with a solid foundation in front-end
            development and user experience design. I'm proficient in
            JavaScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, and I draw on my
            background in theatrical design to create engaging, user-focused
            applications that are both visually appealing and functional. I
            focus on optimizing performance, ensuring cross-browser
            compatibility, and delivering seamless user experiences.
            Collaboration is key for me. I enjoy working with cross-functional
            teams and translating complex technical concepts into clear,
            understandable language for non-technical users. Committed to
            continuous learning, I’m always looking for ways to craft impactful
            solutions that meet user needs and business goals. Let’s create
            something amazing together!

            Beyond the Code
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg px-10">
            With a professional background that bridges the worlds of theater,
            education, and technology, I bring a creative, human-centered
            approach to every project. My time in theatrical design taught me
            the importance of storytelling, aesthetics, and teamwork, skills
            that translate into my work in tech. Equally passionate about
            education and community, I’ve had the privilege of speaking at
            conferences like Orlando Code Camp and Atlanta Cloud Conference,
            where I share insights on feedback, design, and community-building.
            I believe knowledge is meant to be shared and that we all rise
            together when we help others grow. I’m an active volunteer and
            co-organizer in the Atlanta tech scene, where I contribute to
            communities like Atlanta JavaScript, Modern Web, RenderATL, and
            Torc. Whether I’m organizing events, mentoring newcomers, or helping
            to build inclusive spaces, I’m committed to empowering others and
            making tech more accessible and welcoming to all.
