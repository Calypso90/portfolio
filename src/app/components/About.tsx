            I'm a Software Developer with a solid foundation in front-end
            development and user experience design. I'm proficient in
            JavaScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, and I draw on my
            background in theatrical design to create engaging, user-focused
            applications that are both visually appealing and functional.

            I focus on optimizing performance, ensuring cross-browser
            compatibility, and delivering seamless user experiences.
            Collaboration is key for me—I enjoy working with cross-functional
            teams and translating complex technical concepts into clear,
            understandable language for non-technical users.

            craft impactful solutions that meet user needs and business goals.
            Let’s create something amazing together!
